                            &nbsp;  Hello! This video is not related to me at all! My name is Ethan and I like to make random stuff by using some extrememly user-friendly applications and brag to my friends about it on instagram.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;   Here's something I stole from reddit:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A good friend of mine told me this story years ago. He is a the stereotypical old big bad trucker. I've seen some weird stuff with him while driving in south Texas along the border. He never batted an eye, but while telling me this story he had goose bumps and a concerned expression. Which from this guy is about the equivalent of a trembling lip and shit stained pants.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp; I'll tell this story in the first person as he told it to me.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp; Years ago in the late 90's I was on my way from the house (central Texas) heading to Loredo to pick up a load. It was early morning, around 4 or 5. I had just come off a string of days at home, so I know I wasn't tired.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp; I am on one of those two lane winding roads in the absolute middle of bum fuck nowhere, when i see something on the side of the road at the edge of my high beams. At first i just thought it was roadkill, as is usually the case. As I get closer, I see that it is roadkill AND there's someone crouching over the deer carcass. I remember thinking either this guys taking the antlers as a trophy, or he's fucking sick. As I got closer still I can now see that's this guys eating the fucking deer. He's pulling chunks of meat from the stomach and bringing them up to his face. At this point he stops mid motion and looks up at me. Not at my truck, but at me. He/it stands up and that's when I see that its fucking huge, brown, and covered in hair. I remember thinking at this point, oh fuck. This thing is standing on the tiny shoulder looking at me. By this point, maybe 3 seconds have passed and I'm about to the point in the road he's standing at. I didn't even think of stopping, in fact I'm starting to lay on it and get the hell out of there. As I'm passing it, its looking at me, again not at the truck, its looking through the driver's side windshield at me. He obviously has the intelligence to know that there's a driver in here and knows where I'm sitting. As I start to pass him I can still see its head above the hood of an old needle nose Pete. (Old truck design where the hood goes straight out from the windshield, known for being tall and difficult to see around.) This thing is fucking giant. I remember seeing what looked like human intelligence in its eyes. It scares the shit out of me.

                            &nbsp; Sorry for the wall of text. It's a story worth sharing though.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp; TLDR Bigfoot? eating a deer on the side of road.
